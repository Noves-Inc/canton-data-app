# Canton Data App

## Overview

Welcome to the Canton Data App, by Noves.

This is a self-hosted application that takes care of sourcing, indexing, processing and visualizing your Canton data for a variety of reporting scenarios and use cases.

Because it runs in your infrastructure and uses your existing authentication system, it allows you to maintain full security and privacy, as intended in the Canton Network's design philosophy, while still enabling a superior data UX.

## Components

It consists of two primary components:

- Backend indexer/processor: The backend indexes your data, contextualizes it with its real-world meaning, and delivers it in an enriched JSON format that's easily consumed by other applications for financial reporting and other purposes. The JSON schema for Canton transactions is similar to the one we use for reporting on other blockchains (see [docs.noves.fi](https://docs.noves.fi) for more). It's intended to capture the full breadth of relevant details, while simplifying and interpreting a lot of the complexity that comes with raw data.

- Dashboard: The frontend consists of a dashboard that runs on backend-provided data. It allows you to visualize the data in multiple views, filter it by various conditions, graph it, and export it to CSV.

## Deployment

### Initial considerations

The delivery of the app is through two Docker containers, which are assumed to be running in the same network (as part of a docker-compose deployment if you're deploying in a VM, or as two separate Kubernetes deployments in the same namespace, if you're deploying in k8s).

Both containers are stateful, meaning that they have local storage that needs to persist across restarts. We include the exact paths on which a volume or PVC needs to be mounted in the sample manifests.

It is not a requirement that they run in the same network as your Canton validator node. But in practice, we expect this to be the case most of the time (for your own security). All URLs and endpoints are configurable via environment variables.

### Requirements

The backend will need network access to the Ledger API on your validator node.

We assume that the traffic between the backend container and Ledger API will be encrypted, so we have planned for a certificate to be mounted to the container so that it can authenticate secure gRPC requests against the Ledger API.

On your validator node, if not done already, you will need to expose a port for the gRPC Ledger API, and (optionally) enable TLS. We're including exact instructions on how to do this, in a separate file.

For hardware, plan to allocate roughly this for each container:
- Backend container
- Frontend container

### Authentication 

This app leverages your existing authentication system, instead of requiring a new one.

In the current version, the frontend ships native support for **Auth0 authentication** (Keycloak support coming soon).

The backend will always work with any authentication system that is compatible with Canton's JWT standard.

#### Auth0 Setup

The Canton Data App requires Auth0 for end user authentication. You will need to:

1. Create an Auth0 Single Page Application (SPA) for user authentication
2. Configure Canton users with appropriate read permissions for each user (this is already done if you're using Auth0 as your primary authentication provider in the validator)

**Note:** The backend does not authenticate with Auth0 directly. It receives JWT tokens from the frontend and passes them through to Canton's Ledger API.

ðŸ“„ **For detailed Auth0 setup instructions, see: [docker-compose/auth0_setup.md](docker-compose/auth0_setup.md)**

#### Authentication Flow

If you're using the frontend to query the data, you'll sign in with essentially the same flow as logging in to the native Canton Wallet:

- You log in with your user account, which has already been authorized for one or more parties, and the frontend will get a JWT token issued via Auth0 and send that token to the backend, which will retrieve data for the parties you're authorized to read.

For larger organizations, this means that users can only access data for parties that they have previously been granted access to.

### Ingress

We have planned for both the frontend and backend to exposed via a DNS record and https, should you desire to. For example: `canton-data-app-frontend.yourcompany.com`

You'll find sample manifests / config files for nginx in the instructions, but you can use any reverse proxy of your choice. We advise you to leverage your existing reverse proxy (aka your existing nginx instance, if you have one), instead of installing a separate one.

### Port numbers & networking

By default, the backend runs on port 8090 and the frontend runs on port 8091. These are both customizable via environment variables. If you change the default port, make sure to update your docker-compose config or Kubernetes manifest to target the correct port in each container.

Regardless of your deployment topology, it is highly advised that both containers run in the same network, for optimal service-to-service communicationn.

In practice, this means running them inside a docker-compose when deploying in a VM, or running them in the same namespace of a Kubernetes cluster.

For service-to-service communication, there are environment variables that you can set to define the exact URL that the frontend will use to talk to the backend. This will typically be the Kubernetes service name or the name of the container in the docker-compose.

For docker-compose, we assume that you'll be deploying using the same network as the validator node (`splice-validator_splice_validator` network). This is the default setting in our compose file and it allows this app to reference the validator node via a friendly internal DNS name, and vice versa.

### Docker images

Regardless of your chosen deployment topology, you'll be pulling our Docker images hosted from Docker Hub.

The images will launch with the default deployment manifests included in this repository, and upon launch they will authorize your participant ID against our active subscriptions.

### Authorization

To use the app, you must have purchased a license that covers the participant ID you're trying to fetch data for.

For example,  if you purchase a license for your main validator party `validator-party::1220dd5cc6e969cd7d7c11e339fbd07fab5f6fa1f999dc09339228d17299d9d68941`, then you'll be able to pull data for any parties that end in `1220dd5cc6e969cd7d7c11e339fbd07fab5f6fa1f999dc09339228d17299d9d68941`.

## Environment Variables

Both containers are configured via environment variables. Below is a comprehensive reference of all available settings.

### Frontend Environment Variables

| Variable | Example Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8091` | The port the frontend server listens on |
| `CANTON_TRANSLATE_BASE_URL` | `http://canton-data-app-backend:8090` | Internal URL to reach the backend service. For Docker Compose, this is the backend container name and port. For Kubernetes, this is the backend service name. |
| `VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN` | `dev-xxx.us.auth0.com` | Your Auth0 tenant domain |
| `VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` | `abc123...` | The Client ID of your Auth0 SPA application (see [Auth0 Setup](docker-compose/auth0_setup.md)) |
| `VITE_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI` | `https://canton-translate-ui.yourdomain.com/callback` | The callback URL where Auth0 redirects after login. Must match the **Allowed Callback URLs** configured in your Auth0 SPA application. |
| `VITE_AUTH0_LOGOUT_URL` | `https://canton-translate-ui.yourdomain.com` | The URL where users are redirected after logout. Must match the **Allowed Logout URLs** configured in your Auth0 SPA application. |

### Backend Environment Variables

| Variable | Example Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `LOGGING_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Controls logging verbosity. Options: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR` |
| `DB_PATH` | `./index.db` | Path to the database file that stores indexed transaction data |
| `DB_WRITE_BATCH_SIZE` | `500` | Number of transactions to batch together before writing to the database. Higher values improve performance but use more memory. |
| `DB_WRITE_PERIOD` | `5` | How often (in seconds) to write batched data to the database |
| `CANTON_NODE_ADDR` | `splice-validator-participant-1:5001` | Address of the Canton participant's Ledger API. For Docker Compose deployments on the same network, use the participant container name. For external connections, use the fully qualified domain name and port. |
| `CANTON_NODE_CERT_FILE_PATH` | `""` or `/code/cert.crt` | Path to TLS certificate for secure gRPC communication with the Canton Node. **Must be an empty string (`""`)** if the Ledger API does not require TLS (common for Docker Compose deployments). If TLS is required, mount the certificate file and provide its path. |
| `INDEX_MONITOR_PERIOD` | `15` | How often (in seconds) the indexer checks for new transactions from the Canton Network |
| `MAX_WORKER_RETRIES` | `20` | Number of times the backend indexing worker will attempt to connect to the Ledger API before permanently failing. |

**Important:** The backend does not require Auth0 credentials. It receives JWT tokens from the frontend and passes them through to Canton's Ledger API for validation. You can also call the backend's API directly if you generate a valid JWT token on your own.
